# cwlb.me

This is my personal site. It is static and bespoke.

I originally hand-rolled it in 2014 when I did not know how to build maintainable websites.

I'm still pretty sure I can't write maintainable css, even though I used a preprocessor from the beginning.

Every time I change hosting providers, I discover a new way to rebuild the css.
